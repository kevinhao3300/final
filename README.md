# Problem
We are given a two-dimensional matrix of english characters. We have to find a set of english words with some specified lengths such that each english word can be "found" in the matrix, and every character in the matrix is used exactly once. An english word can be found in the matrix when every letter in the word is in the board, and every letter is adjancent to its neighbors in one of the eight directions.
